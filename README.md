# Air-Quality-analysis
A beginner friendly data analysis project that uses kaggle dataset(Air Quality) collected from Milan,Italy from March 2004 to February 2005

This project:
>>clean real world air quality data by handling missing values and converting string values to float values for distribution
>>Visualize pollutant distribution using histograms
>>generates mean,count,std,min,25%,50%,75%,max for each variable

Did this project by watching pandas,matplotlib tutotrials on youtube and learned lot of things
